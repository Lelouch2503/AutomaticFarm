Description:
- This project involves the development of a web interface that displays real-time data and charts sourced from Firebase. The interface presents various parameters and graphical representations over time. 
- Additionally, it offers configuration options for three watering modes.

- The system is built around an ESP32 microcontroller, which communicates with temperature, air humidity, and soil moisture sensors. These sensors collect environmental data crucial for plant growth. 
The ESP32 retrieves data from Firebase, enabling dynamic adjustments to the watering process based on real-time conditions.

- By leveraging Firebase's capabilities, the project ensures efficient and automated irrigation control, optimizing plant health and growth.

Hardware: Esp32, dht11, Soil Humidity Sensor.

Database: Realtime Firebase service.

Programming language: C++, Html, Css, Javascript
